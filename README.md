# Go Cache Library

This Go library provides implementations of three different types of caches:

1. **Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache**
2. **Least Frequently Used (LFU) Cache**
3. **Time-Based Expiration Cache**

These caches can be used to efficiently manage data with various eviction strategies based on your application's needs.

## Installation

To install the Go Cache Library, use the `go get` command:

```bash
go get github.com/Anarr/cache
